## Running the Project

If you are on windows and have the correct Godot version with the default name in a folder on your path, you can just run:

```ps
bat\editor-rc.bat
```

That line will automatically start Godot 4.3-rc3 in verbose mode, skipping the project selection screen.

## Deploying the project

The project should be exported to (those folders already have a `.gdignore` so the editor won't load them):

- `res://exports/web`: web version
- `res://exports/win`: windows version
- `res://exports/lin`: linux version

After exporting, the following commands (assuming you have butler setup) will deploy each version:

- `bat\itch-web.bat`: web version
- `bat\itch-win.bat`: windows version
- `bat\itch-lin.bat`: linux version
