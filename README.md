## Adding Audio

Put audio files in one of these folders:

- `res://assets/audio/Master`: basically shouldn't be used, only used for the test sound
- `res://assets/audio/BGM`: music
- `res://assets/audio/SFX`: sound effects
- `res://assets/audio/UI`: UI interactions (button clicks, focus/hover, etc)

**Important**: Open the audio scene (`res://game/autoload/audio.tscn`) and save.
That will update the `NamedAudio` enum based on the files in those folders automatically.

To play audio from anywhere use the `play_named_...` functions:

- `Audio.play_named_ui(NamedAudio.UI.UI_ButtonClick)`
- `Audio.play_named_bgm(NamedAudio.BGM.BGM_BackgroundMusicName)`
- `Audio.play_named_sfx(NamedAudio.SFX.SFX_Boom)`

## Running the Project

If you are on windows and have the correct Godot version with the default name in a folder on your path, you can just run:

```ps
bat\editor-rc.bat
```

That line will automatically start Godot 4.3-rc3 in verbose mode, skipping the project selection screen.

## Deploying the project

The project should be exported to (those folders already have a `.gdignore` so the editor won't load them):

- `res://exports/web`: web version
- `res://exports/win`: windows version
- `res://exports/lin`: linux version

After exporting, the following commands (assuming you have butler setup) will deploy each version:

- `bat\itch-web.bat`: web version
- `bat\itch-win.bat`: windows version
- `bat\itch-lin.bat`: linux version
